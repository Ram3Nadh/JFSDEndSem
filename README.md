# JFSDEndSem
This repo contains solution for my JFSD EndSem Lab.

my question in simple words-
Develop a Maven Spring project to demonstrate constructor dependency injection (CDI) and setter autowiring. Create an Employee class with properties: employeeId (Integer), name (String), salary (Double), department (String), and skills (List<String>), and implement CDI for these dependencies. Additionally, create Course and Instructor classes where Course has properties: courseId, courseName, credits, and an Instructor object, while Instructor includes instructorId, name, email, and phoneNumber. Use setter autowiring to inject the Instructor object into the Course class. Demonstrate the implementation in a ClientDemo class using XML or Java configuration in the com.klef.jfsd.exam package.
